Additional Information
Valkey is a community-driven fork of Redis under the BSD license, built after Redis core moved to a source-available model.

It offers drop-in compatibility with Redis 7.x+ and supports the majority of Redis features, including persistence, replication, Lua scripting, pub/sub, and modules.

Kubernetes-native deployments are supported via Helm charts or Kustomize templates.

Horizontal scaling is achievable with Redis Cluster mode; vertical scaling via PVCs and memory tuning.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is achievable through Kubernetes namespaces and Valkey ACLs.

Monitoring is available via Prometheus exporters; alerting through Grafana Alerting or AlertManager.

Valkey modules (ValkeyJSON, ValkeyTimeSeries, etc.) are available as maintained forks of Redis modules.
