To optimise the cost of the Redis CIB cluster, we collected all the existant DBs, to reduce the cost we suggest to contact all the application in DEV, INT and PPRD environnements to check with them if they will be going on PRD or not, if not we suggest that we can decomissionate the DBs related to it on the other environments. Since we don’t have access to the servers because it belongs to the socle team we can’t access the servers and check how much is used compared to what was requested.
