Hey Team,

Just circling back as I didn’t get any replies to my last email 😅
Meanwhile, the Snowboard backlog is still growing, and some folks (Oumar 👀) have 10+ tickets sitting there.

Let’s take a moment to:

Reassign or close tickets if they’re not active

Follow up on any blockers

Use the “Backlog” status to flag what needs review

If things stay untouched, I’ll start jumping in where needed — goal is to keep the board clean and actionable ✨

Access sheet is attached again for your updates.

Thanks all,
