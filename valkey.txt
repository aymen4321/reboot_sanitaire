‚úèÔ∏èBeta - Architecture - Introduction
Redis Enterprise Architecture consists of Redis Database Nodes for in-memory data storage, a Redis Enterprise Cluster (REC) for high availability management, and a Proxy for load balancing, connection pooling, and SSL termination. Additional layers include Redis Enterprise Modules (e.g., RediSearch, RedisGraph) for enhanced functionality, Persistence & Backup for optional disk persistence, and Monitoring & Alerting for performance insights. It can be deployed on-premises, in the Cloud (e.g., AWS, GCP), on Kubernetes, or as a fully managed service (Redis Enterprise Cloud).
