Dear [Client Name],

We have identified a recurring Kafka consumption lag occurring daily at approximately 23:20, impacting topic consumption performance. Our monitoring indicates a network throughput spike at the same time, which correlates with the observed lag and temporary drop in message processing.

✅ What we’ve verified so far:

Kafka brokers are healthy and operational

Topics and consumer groups are active

No internal application or Kafka errors observed

🔍 Current hypothesis:
The lag appears to be related to external system activity (e.g., backup, patching, or data transfer jobs) saturating network or I/O bandwidth around 23:20.

📌 Next steps:

Coordinate with infrastructure teams to review scheduled jobs at/around 23:20

Analyze system-level logs and resource usage on Kafka brokers and consumers

Prepare mitigation measures (e.g., job rescheduling, bandwidth throttling, or consumer tuning)

We will keep you updated with our findings and recommendations. Please let us know if there have been any known activities or deployments scheduled at that time window.

Best regards,
