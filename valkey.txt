Hi Team,

I've noticed our Snowboard backlog is getting pretty crowded, with a growing number of tickets still hanging around (and a lot of them in black 🖤). To help clean things up, I’ve created a dedicated “Backlog” status so we can better track and redistribute these tickets.

👉 I’d like to propose a short session (1–2 hours) to go through the backlog together and reassign tickets where possible. This will help us move things forward and keep our board clean and manageable.

📌 Note: Not everyone has access to all the tools (like Ops Manager or PSSIT), so I’ve attached an Excel sheet listing current access status. Feel free to update it if anything’s missing.

Let’s build the reflex of keeping our backlog lean – and make our Snowboard shine again! ✨
Looking forward to your input and support.
