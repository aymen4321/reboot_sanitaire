Beta - Architecture - Introduction
Valkey Architecture is based on a high-performance, in-memory key-value data store derived from Redis 7.2+, with a strong open governance model. A typical Valkey deployment includes Valkey nodes running in standalone or clustered mode for horizontal scalability, optional Sentinel-based high availability, and a client-access layer for connection management.

Advanced capabilities can be layered in via community-supported extensions (e.g., ValkeyJSON, ValkeyBloom) or Kubernetes-native orchestration. Data persistence is optionally supported via RDB and AOF mechanisms. Monitoring and alerting are integrated using Prometheus/Grafana, or with third-party observability tools.

Valkey can be deployed:

On-premises

In private or public cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)

Inside Kubernetes clusters (Helm charts or Operators)

As part of DevOps pipelines for caching, session storage, or analytics acceleration

ðŸ“’Beta - Architecture - Scope
âœ… Greenfield Deployment (New Cluster)
Environment: New Kubernetes Cluster (no existing Redis workloads)

Valkey Version: Latest stable OSS release (7.2+)

Infrastructure: Dedicated compute and memory (in-memory workload profile)

Expertise: Familiarity with Redis/Valkey, Helm, K8s, Prometheus

Support model: Community-based, GitHub issues, OSS contributions

âœ… Brownfield Deployment (Existing Infrastructure)
Kubernetes: Existing cluster with workloads already running

Compatibility: Ensure Kubernetes version supports Helm chart for Valkey

Resource allocation: Dedicated namespaces, tolerations, and node selectors if needed

Integration: Prometheus monitoring, centralized log aggregation

Support: Requires internal expertise or external integration partner

âœ… Hybrid / Mixed Deployment
On-premises + Cloud hybrid: Valkey can run across heterogeneous environments

Use cases: Caching, real-time feature stores, fraud scoring, queueing systems

Design goal: Low-latency, high availability using master-replica or cluster mode
